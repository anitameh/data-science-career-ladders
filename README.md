## 1. Getting started

**Column- and row-names**

* There is no expectation that the boxes move in lockstep; in fact, it is highly unlikely that you fall into just one level for every category.
* Rather, your level is determined by whether the majority (currently, 3+) of categories fall into a particular level.
* The bullets outlined in each box are the minimum requirements for you to be at this level in that category.
* The hope is that this is a resource that 1) provides concrete guidelines that you can lean on and 2) a common language to have this discussion with your manager, and Rachel and Sherry.

**Can you explain the track split for IC (individual contributor), and management?**

* Right before the VP level*, the track splits into parallel tracks, one for management and one for individual contributor.
* Here, expectations ramp up dramatically: each successive level now can be considered as representing a different job role than the previous level.
* However, on either of the tracks, the expectations indicate a level of broad leadership, that requires thought leadership, as well as the ability to engage groups of people both within technology and outside of it to make bigger and bigger things happen.
* The question to ask yourself here is “Do I want to build bigger and better systems, or do I want to manage bigger and better teams?”

**Why are there are 7-8 levels, and where did this number come from?**

* These ladders were in large part built off of the awesome engineering ladders and best practices leveraged by Rent the Runway, Foursquare, Google, Airbnb, StitchFix, and Amazon. The majority of these ladders seemed to converge on approximately 7-8 levels, which is similarly reflected in these.
* There are no publicly available data science career ladders, to our knowledge. As such, these ladders were built, iterated on & discussed dozens of times, and refined with representatives from human resources, data science team leads and people managers.
* It is totally anticipated that these ladders will evolve over time! If individuals on the team believe more levels should be added - or should be trimmed - to reflect the current state of the team and the industry, this is something your team should expect to discuss and incorporate accordingly.

**Some things of note**

* Importantly, you will notice that as you progress, the number of critical skills required for you to perform at the highest levels tend to fall in the categories centered around delivery, impact, and communication and leadership, _regardless of which track you pursue_.
* Of course, these skills are necessarily built on core foundational technological skills, and it is an expectation (as outlined in the ladders) that you establish methods / processes / ways of working for yourself to stay abreast of industry-wide technological changes.
* However, your core competencies as a team member and leader on this team as you grow in your career  will rely heavily on collaborative skills and empathy, aligned with the values of your team.
* It is _highly recommended_ that before being promoted, an individual has the experience of having the responsibility and accountability associated with being a squad lead. This will allow you to more effectively make an informed decision about which track you are currently interested in pursuing.
